### Solutions to homework implemented in Kotlin

Updated through chapter 2.

Note: the problems in this repo were solved using the Kotlin language.
The repo is configured for the Intellij IDEA system and gradle.
Gradle can be used to build it (gradlew init build test) for example.
All exercises contain a "Jupiter" (junit) test module located 
in the `src/test/kotlin` folder.
