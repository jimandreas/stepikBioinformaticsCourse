# Notes on various problems

Some topics in the cirriculum presented challenges in understanding and 
in algorithm development.   My notes on these topics are below.

*Abstract:*

Given a finite tree, some of whose vertices are identified with given 
finite sequences, 
we show how to construct sequences for all the remaining 
vertices simultaneously, 
so as to minimize the total edge-length of the tree. 
Edge-length is calculated by a metric whose biological 
significance is the mutational distance between two sequences.
