/**

Code Challenge: Solve the Overlap Alignment Problem.

Input: Two strings v and w, each of length at most 1000.

Output: The score of an optimal overlap alignment of v and w,
followed by an alignment of a suffix v' of v and a prefix w' of w
achieving this maximum score. Use an alignment score in which
matches count +1 and both the mismatch and indel penalties are 2.
