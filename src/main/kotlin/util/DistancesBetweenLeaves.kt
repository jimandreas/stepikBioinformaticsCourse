Distances Between Leaves Problem: Compute the distances between leaves in a weighted tree.

Input:  An integer n followed by the adjacency list of a weighted tree with n leaves.

Output: An n x n matrix (di,j), where di,j is the length of the path between leaves i and j.

/**

Code Challenge: Solve the Distances Between Leaves Problem.
The tree is given as an adjacency list of a graph whose leaves
are integers between 0 and n - 1; the notation a->b:c
means that node a is connected to node b by an edge of weight c.
The matrix you return should be space-separated.
